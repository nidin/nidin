# PROFILE

I help companies to achieve agile-friendly implementation technology (like microservices) and architecture. I have extensive experience in building highly functional lean and agile organizations and designing and building robust, highly scalable software suitable for agile environments. As a software engineer, I am always curious about how things are working. Engineering skills are embedded in my DNA. Programming languages never laid barriers in my journey. For me logic is important, it may be expressed in a variety of languages. During my career journey, I mastered several languages and technologies but my quick learning skills are ready to absorb any new technology at my will.
